# Steam

Steam is a minimal and customizable theme for bloggers and was developed by [Tommaso Barbato](//github.com/epistrephein). He created it as a slightly adapted version of the [Vapor](//github.com/sethlilly/Vapor) Ghost theme by [Seth Lilly](//github.com/sethlilly). Noteworthy features of this Hugo port are the integration of a comment-system either powered by Disqus or Google Plus, the customizable appearance by changing theme colors, support for RSS feeds, syntax highlighting for source code and the optional use of Google Analytics. Enough to read. Let's take the first steps to get started.

## Installation

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ mkdir themes
    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme.git

For more information read the official [setup guide](//gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### The config file

Take a look inside the [`exampleSite`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/) folder of this theme. You'll find a file called [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml).

To use it, copy the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) in the root folder of your Hugo site. Feel free to change strings as you like to customize your website.

## Add links to the navigation

You can add custom pages like this by adding `menu = "main"` in the frontmatter:

```toml
+++
date  = "2015-08-22"
title = "About me"
menu  = "main"
+++
```

If no document contains menu = "main" in the frontmatter than the navigation will not be shown


## Customize theme colors

This theme features four different theme colors (green as default, blue, red and orange) that change the appearance of you Hugo site slightly. Just set the `themeColor` variable to the color you like.

Furthermore you can create your own theme. Under [`layouts/partials/themes`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/tree/dev/layouts/partials/themes) you'll find a stylesheet template called [`custom-theme.html`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/blob/dev/layouts/partials/themes/custom-theme.html). Customize the colors as you like and save the new theme with the schema `<myNewColor>-theme.html` within the same folder. As you can see, the color is the prefix of the stylesheet template. Therefore you just need to set `themeColor` in the [`configs`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml)) to that self-defined prefix. 

## Comments

This theme features a comment system that's either powered by Disqus or Google Plus. Enable one of those services by setting the `comments` variable in the the [`config.toml`](//github.com/digitalcraftsman/hugo-steam-theme/blob/dev/exampleSite/config.toml) to `disqus` or `googleplus`. In order to use Disqus you need to enter your shortname in disqusShortname at the top of the configuration file too.

## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server. 

    $ hugo server -w

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
